PApp::SQL - absolutely easy yet fast and powerful sql access

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PApp::SQL;

 my $st = sql_exec $DBH, "select ... where a = ?", $a;

 local $DBH = <database handle>;
 my $st = sql_exec \my($bind_a, $bind_b), "select a,b ...";
 my $st = sql_insertid
             sql_exec "insert into ... values (?, ?)", $v1, $v2;
 my $a = sql_fetch "select a from ...";
 sql_fetch \my($a, $b), "select a,b ...";

 sql_exists "name from table where name like 'a%'"
    or die "a* required but not existent";

 my $db = new PApp::SQL::Database "", "DBI:mysql:test", "user", "pass";
 local $PApp::SQL::DBH = $db->checked_dbh; # does 'ping'

 sql_exec $db->dbh, "select ...";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides you with easy-to-use functions to execute sql
commands (using DBI). Despite being easy to use, they are also quite
efficient and allow you to write faster programs in less lines of code. It
should work with anything from perl-5.004_01 onwards, but I only support
5.005+. UTF8 handling (the C<sql_u*> family of functions) will only be
effective with perl version 5.006 and beyond.

If the descriptions here seem terse or if you always wanted to know
what PApp is then have a look at the PApp module which uses this module
extensively but also provides you with a lot more gimmicks to play around
with to help you create cool applications ;)

=head2 GLOBAL VARIABLES

=over 4

=item $sql_exec

Since the C<sql_exec> family of functions return a statement handle there
must eb another way to test the return value of the C<execute> call. This
global variable contains the result of the most recent call to C<execute>
done by this module.

=item $PApp::SQL::DBH

The default database handle used by this module if no C<$DBH> was
specified as argument and no C<$DBH> is found in the current package. See
C<sql_exec> for a discussion.

=item $PApp::SQL::Database

The current default C<PApp::SQL::Database>-object. Future versions might
automatically fall back on this database and create database handles from
it if neccessary. At the moment this is not used by this module but might
be nice as a placeholder for the database object that corresponds to
$PApp::SQL::DBH.

=head2 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item $dbh = connect_cached $id, $dsn, $user, $pass, $flags, $connect

(not exported by by default)

Connect to the database given by C<($dsn,$user,$pass)>, while using the
flags from C<$flags>. These are just the same arguments as given to
C<DBI->connect>.

The database handle will be cached under the unique id
C<$id|$dsn|$user|$pass>. If the same id is requested later, the
cached handle will be checked (using ping), and the connection will
be re-established if necessary (be sure to prefix your application or
module name to the id to make it "more" unique. Things like __PACKAGE__ .
__LINE__ work fine as well).

The reason C<$id> is necessary is that you might specify special connect
arguments or special flags, or you might want to configure your $DBH
differently than maybe other applications requesting the same database
connection. If none of this is becessary for your application you can
leave $id empty (i.e. "").

If specified, C<$connect> is a callback (e.g. a coderef) that will be
called each time a new connection is being established, with the new
C<$dbh> as first argument.

Examples:

 # try your luck opening the papp database without access info
 $dbh = connect_cached __FILE__, "DBI:mysql:papp";

Mysql-specific behaviour: The default setting of mysql_client_found_rows
is TRUE, you can overwrite this, though.

=cut

sub connect_cached {
   my ($id, $dsn, $user, $pass, $flags, $connect) = @_;
   # the following line is duplicated in PApp::SQL::Database::new
   $id = "$id\0$dsn\0$user\0$pass";
   unless ($dbcache{$id} && $dbcache{$id}->ping) {
      # first, nuke our statement cache (sooory ;)
      cachesize cachesize 0;

      # then make mysql behave more standardly by default
      $dsn =~ /^[Dd][Bb][Ii]:mysql:/
         and $dsn !~ /;mysql_client_found_rows/
            and $dsn .= ";mysql_client_found_rows=1";

      # then connect anew
      $dbcache{$id} =
         eval { DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, $flags) }
         || eval { DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, $flags) }
         || die "unable to connect to database $dsn: $DBI::errstr\n";
      $connect->($dbcache{$id}) if $connect;
   }
   $dbcache{$id};
}

=item $sth = sql_exec [dbh,] [bind-vals...,] "sql-statement", [arguments...]

=item $sth = sql_uexec <see sql_exec>

C<sql_exec> is the most important and most-used function in this module.

Runs the given sql command with the given parameters and returns the
statement handle. The command and the statement handle will be cached
(with the database handle and the sql string as key), so prepare will be
called only once for each distinct sql call (please keep in mind that the
returned statement will always be the same, so, if you call C<sql_exec>
with the same dbh and sql-statement twice (e.g. in a subroutine you
called), the statement handle for the first call mustn't be used.

The database handle (the first argument) is optional. If it is missing,
C<sql_exec> first tries to use the variable C<$DBH> in the current (=
calling) package and, if that fails, it tries to use database handle in
C<$PApp::SQL::DBH>, which you can set before calling these functions.

The actual return value from the C<$sth->execute> call is stored in the
package-global (and exported) variable C<$sql_exec>.

If any error occurs C<sql_exec> will throw an exception.

C<sql_uexec> is similar to C<sql_exec> but upgrades all input arguments to
utf8 before calling the C<execute> method.

Examples:

 # easy one
 my $st = sql_exec "select name, id from table where id = ?", $id;
 while (my ($name, $id) = $st->fetchrow_array) { ... };

 # the fastest way to use dbi, using bind_columns
 my $st = sql_exec \my($name, $id),
                   "select name, id from table where id = ?",
                   $id;
 while ($st->fetch) { ...}

 # now use a different dastabase:
 sql_exec $dbh, "update file set name = ?", "oops.txt";


=item sql_fetch <see sql_exec>

=item sql_ufetch <see sql_uexec>

Execute an sql-statement and fetch the first row of results. Depending on
the caller context the row will be returned as a list (array context), or
just the first columns. In table form:

 CONTEXT	RESULT
 void		()
 scalar		first column
 list		array

C<sql_fetch> is quite efficient in conjunction with bind variables:

 sql_fetch \my($name, $amount),
           "select name, amount from table where id name  = ?",
           "Toytest";

But of course the normal way to call it is simply:

 my($name, $amount) = sql_fetch "select ...", args...

... and it's still quite fast unless you fetch large amounts of data.

C<sql_ufetch> is similar to C<sql_fetch> but upgrades all input values to
utf8 and forces all result values to utf8.

=item sql_fetchall <see sql_exec>

=item sql_ufetchall <see sql_uexec>

Similarly to C<sql_fetch>, but all result rows will be fetched (this is
of course inefficient for large results!). The context is ignored (only
list context makes sense), but the result still depends on the number of
columns in the result:

 COLUMNS	RESULT
 0		()
 1		(row1, row2, row3...)
 many		([row1], [row2], [row3]...)

Examples (all of which are inefficient):

 for (sql_fetchall "select id from table") { ... }

 my @names = sql_fetchall "select name from user";

 for (sql_fetchall "select name, age, place from user") {
    my ($name, $age, $place) = @$_;
 }

C<sql_ufetchall> is similar to C<sql_fetchall> but upgrades all input
values to utf8 and forces all result values to utf8.

=item sql_exists "<table> where ...", args...

=item sql_uexists <see sql_exists>

Check wether the result of the sql-statement "select xxx from
$first_argument" would be empty or not (that is, imagine the string
"select * from" were prepended to your statement (it isn't)). Should work
with every database but can be quite slow, except on mysql, where this
should be quite fast.

C<sql_uexists> is similar to C<sql_exists> but upgrades all parameters to
utf8.

Examples:

 print "user 7 exists!\n"
    if sql_exists "user where id = ?", 7;
 
 die "duplicate key"
    if sql_exists "user where name = ? and pass = ?", "stefan", "geheim";

=cut

=item $lastid = sql_insertid $sth

Returns the last automatically created key value. It must be executed
directly after executing the insert statement that created it. This is
what is actually returned for various databases. If your database is
missing, please send me an e-mail on how to implement this ;)

 mysql:    first C<AUTO_INCREMENT> column set to NULL
 postgres: C<oid> column (is there a way to get the last SERIAL?)
 sybase:   C<IDENTITY> column of the last insert (slow)
 informix: C<SERIAL> or C<SERIAL8> column of the last insert

Except for sybase, this does not require a server access.

=cut

sub sql_insertid($) {
   my $sth = shift or die "sql_insertid requires a statement handle";
   my $dbh = $sth->{Database};
   my $driver = $dbh->{Driver}{Name};

   $driver eq "mysql"    and return $sth->{mysql_insertid};
   $driver eq "Pg"       and return $sth->{pg_oid_status};
   $driver eq "Sybase"   and return sql_fetch($dbh, 'SELECT @@IDENTITY');
   $driver eq "Informix" and return $sth->{ix_sqlerrd}[1];

   die "sql_insertid does not spport the dbd driver '$driver', please see PApp::SQL::sql_insertid";
}

=item [old-size] = cachesize [new-size]

Returns (and possibly changes) the LRU cache size used by C<sql_exec>. The
default is somewhere around 50 (= the 50 last recently used statements
will be cached). It shouldn't be too large, since a simple linear listed
is used for the cache at the moment (which, for small (<100) cache sizes
is actually quite fast).

The function always returns the cache size in effect I<before> the call,
so, to nuke the cache (for example, when a database connection has died
or you want to garbage collect old database/statement handles), this
construct can be used:

 PApp::SQL::cachesize PApp::SQL::cachesize 0;

=cut

=item reinitialize [not exported]

Clears any internal caches (statement cache, database handle
cache). Should be called after C<fork> and other accidents that invalidate
database handles.

=cut

sub reinitialize {
   cachesize cachesize 0;
   for (values %dbcache) {
      eval { $_->{InactiveDestroy} = 1 };
   }
   undef %dbcache;
}

package PApp::SQL::Database;

=head2 THE DATABASE CLASS

Again (sigh) the problem of persistency. What do you do when you have
to serialize on object that contains (or should contain) a database
handle? Short answer: you don't. Long answer: you can embed the necessary
information to recreate the dbh when needed.

The C<PApp::SQL::Database> class does that, in a relatively efficient
fashion: the overhead is currently a single method call per access (you
can cache the real dbh if you want).

=over 4

=item $db = new <same arguments as C<connect_cached>>

The C<new> call takes the same arguments as C<connect_cached> (obviously,
if you supply a connect callback it better is serializable, see
L<PApp::Callback>!) and returns a serializable database class. No database
handle is actually being created.

=item $db->dbh

Return the database handle as fast as possible (usually just a hash lookup).

=item $db->checked_dbh

Return the database handle, but first check that the database is still
available and re-open the connection if necessary.

=cut

sub new($$;@) {
   my $class = shift;
   my ($id, $dsn, $user, $pass, $flags, $connect) = @_;
   # the following line is duplicated in PApp::SQL::Database::new
   my $id2 = "$id\0$dsn\0$user\0$pass";
   bless [$id2, $flags, $connect], $class;
}

# the following two functions better be fast!
sub dbh($) {
   $dbcache{$_[0][0]} || $_[0]->checked_dbh;
}

sub checked_dbh($) {
   my $dbh = $dbcache{$_[0][0]};
   $dbh && $dbh->ping
      ? $dbh
      : PApp::SQL::connect_cached((split /\x00/, $_[0][0]), $_[0][1], $_[0][2]);
}

=item $db->dsn

Return the DSN (L<DBI>) fo the database object (e.g. for error messages).

=item $db->login

Return the login name.

=item $db->password

Return the password (emphasizing the fact that the apssword is stored plaintext ;)

=cut

sub dsn($) {
   my $self = shift;
   (split /\x00/, $self->[0])[1];
}

sub login($) {
   my $self = shift;
   (split /\x00/, $self->[0])[2];
}

sub password($) {
   my $self = shift;
   (split /\x00/, $self->[0])[3];
